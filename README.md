# Developer-Website
Portfolio of Web Development Work

Welcome! 

You have found yourself at a very exciting point in my development as a developer by being privy to my very first portfolio website!

As I am a baby-developer myself, you'll find this space rather wanting in deployed projects. Fear not, I built it and they will come...eventually. 

For the time being, feel free to evalute my skills based on my codding and styling of this page using html, css, js, and Drew grit. (I hope you like name-based puns and word play, there's no turning back now.) 

Rather than bore the visitor to death with another regurgitation of Lorem Ipsum boilerplate, I've supplemented the profile with various outside projects and credentials, substituting for my future showcase of deployed projects. That is, in case the visitor should have any doubts of my commitment to hard work and long-term projects, they may peruse those that are already well underway. 

This profile page is semantically organized, accessible, target-styled, with some personal touches thrown in to demonstrate personality and sensibilty to potential employers. While a mastery of the course work is essential for potential employers to gauge my competence, they also need to be able to determine if I am a personality they would want on their team as well. Synergy!

My favotie aspect of this portfolio is that it's also highly responsive. Blow it up, shrink it down, the page will move with you so there's no threat of vertigo while you scroll. 

Here is a final snapshot of the homescreen before deployment, adjusted to a very skinny window to demonstrate the responsiveness of the code:
